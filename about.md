I am passionate about finding solutions for the problems I encounter. For me the goal is the product best fitting the needs and the way that leads there is high quality code. High quality means tested, maintainable clean code, written by the right tools. I believe in the scientific approach instead of beliefs and presumptions.

As a full stack developer I work with wide a variety of platforms, Python, Java, Javascript and Go. I am very committed to automation and Infrastructure as code culture. Currently I am working as Lead Developer at Dmlab, a data analytics company. Previously I worked in mobile application development and bioinformatics.

I blog about things I do or I wish I would do as a coder/developer/devops engineer.

Most of the time I work with Java, Python, Javascript and Go.

Things I'm interested in and write about:

- Software development
- Data analytics
