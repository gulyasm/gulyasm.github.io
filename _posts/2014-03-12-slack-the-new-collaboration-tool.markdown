I often try to draw the attention of people how inefficient the email is as a collaboration and information sharing platform. 
It's well established and everyone know how to use it, but sadly, very few avoid abusing it. I am shocked how many people use the attachments as a shared drive, and how many people use it as a version control tool. Knowledge usually sent through email, and labels and folders should provide the way to organize that information. It doesn't work. 

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a new collaboration tool where you can share oneline status updates and you can integrate a plethora of [other services](https://slack.com/integrations). It's not just a replacement of the email, it is a true collaboration platform. You can see commits and branches from git, build updates from Jenkins and alerts from nagios or other infrastructure alerting system. It creates and transparency, something I truly believe in. Everyone can see what's going on.

With slack, everything that happens within your team is visible to everyone. Slack organizes communication with channels which feels natural. We have channels for projects, teams, and sometimes they are topic based, like the #WorldCup2014.
