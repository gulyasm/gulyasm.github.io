# Technologies

Every interesting technologies list depends on where your interest lies in. As I go deeper and deeper in system administration and operations I found these technologies more and more sexy. No surprise devops related tools made it to the list.

## Docker

Docker will really take of this year. Google stands now behind them, and finally they are not beta anymore. As someone who has devops related tasks everyday, I see docker as a huge gain in productivity and workload. Not when you start with it and I still investigate where does it fit the best and how into our processes, but I have high hopes about it.
Go

Ken Thompson and other big shot engineers started a new language as the were not satisfied with C++. Not so shocking news if you are familiar with C++14. It's not the concepts or the direction it's heading, but when you try it feels kind of alien now. Go on the other hand feels natural and productive. After using it a few days I can really imagine myself using this in some tooling or something close to production. Not in production, but it can change this year.

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open-source distributed time series database with a vibrant and productive ecosystem. We use Graphite in many projects, as a monitoring tool or as a timeseries database, but InfluxDB is a valid alternative now. It is a mature product now and even though it still doesn't offer as much as Graphite, you may find it more convenient to use. And it's written in Go.

## Functional languages

This is something I don't personally like, but the trend is clear. More and more talks, conferences focus on functional languages. We have more and more languages and not just new ones, old ones like Javascript introduce functional elements. Someone bring me popcorn, this one will be interesting to watch.

## Learning list 2014

- Docker
- more node.js and javascript. Hello ECMAScript 6!
